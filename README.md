## Project Assignment

[Link referring to the assignment along with the rules of it](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors#assignment)

## Approach

Wrote some pseudo code on a notepad, some in the comments inside the JS file, a lot of trial and error, hardest part was getting the prompt to work as `.value` method wouldn't work here, instead I had to use `.includes` method which worked flawlessely (thank you Dave J. for the recommendation and help).

## Technology Stack

For the project, I have used the following technologies:
* HTML5 - as assignment states, single HTML page to simply link the JS file.
* JavaScript - overall *RPS* project logic containing multiple functions, some of the code may be refactored later on with additional functions combined with HTML & CSS.

## Bugs

Shall you encounter any bugs, do not hesitate to open an issue!
